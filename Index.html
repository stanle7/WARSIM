  // Attempt to open in a new tab. Still subject to security restrictions.
  window.open('./dos.html', '_blank');

  // --- Action 2: Change the current website to google.com ---

<p>
Please note: The attempt to open "./dos.html" is unlikely to succeed due to browser security settings designed to protect your local files. The primary action that will occur is that this page will navigate to google.com.
